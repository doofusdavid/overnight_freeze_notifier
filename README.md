# overnight_freeze_notifier

My wife has a horse being boarded outside, and wanted to know when she needed to run to him to cover him with a blanket.  
She needed to set a temperature limit and get notified.  I created this with a few requirements.

- Docker image shown here: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/doofusdavid/overnightfreezenotifier
- Sample .env provided in the Repo.  Temperature in Farenheit, Lat/Lng works to 4 decimal places.
